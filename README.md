# Life Expectancy Data Visualisation

## Overview

This is a simple portfolio project which I have completed as part of the Codecademy Data Scientist Career Path. A dataset was provided and the task was to visualise it as if we were to create a blog post using the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a csv file containing the following fields:

- Country
- Year
- Life Expectancy at Birth (in years)
- GDP ($)

The file contained data for six countries and covered the years 2000 - 2-15.

## Findings

In 2015:

- USA had the largest GDP of any country in the dataset, followed by China
- Germany had the highest life expectancy
- Zimbabwe had the lowest GDP and the lowest life expectancy by 15 years

Across the time period (2000-2015):

-USA and China have experienced significantly higher economic growth than the other countries
-USA has experienced steady economic growth
-China's economic growth accelerated from around 2005 onwards
-Zimbabwe's life expectancy at birth fell in the early 2000s and has risen sharply since
-All of the other countries have experienced more gradual life expectancy increases

On the relationship between GDP and life expectancy:

- Overall, GDP is a poor predictor of life expectancy - GDP per capita would be more helpful
- In all of the countries, there is a positive relationship between GDP and life expectancy (although this does not necessarily mean causation)
- This relationship is strongest in Zimbabwe, the least developed country in the dataset

Some of the key visuals from the project are shown below:
